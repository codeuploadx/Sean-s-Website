            <h1>My Hobbies</h1> 
            <p>I mostly spend my free time on playing Bass Guitar, Reading Fictional Books, and playing games. But in some occassions, I do spend my time with my close friends and my family. I don't have that much hobbies to help me out from my boredom but it did help me keep my sanity in check during the Pandemic.</p>
